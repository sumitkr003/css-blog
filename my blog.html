	<p class="firstparagraph">Till now, we have only discussed one-dimensional arrays. One-dimensional arrays are organized linearly in only one direction. But at times, we need to store data in the form of grids or tables. Here, the concept of single-dimension arrays is extended to incorporate two-dimensional data structures.</p>
	<p> However, when we store the elements in a column major order, the elements of the first column are stored before the elements of the second and third column. That is, the elements of the array are stored column by column where m elements of the first column will occupy the first m locations. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.3</p>
	<p>Like in the case of other variables, declaring a two-dimensional array only reserves space for the array in the memory. No values are stored in it. A two-dimensional array is initialized in the same way as a one-dimensional array is initialized. For example, </p>

	<h1>My second article</h1>
	<p class="firstparagraph">Although we have shown a rectangular picture of a two-dimensional array, in the memory, these elements actually will be stored sequentially. There are two ways of storing a two-dimensional array in the memory. The first way is the row major order and the second is the column major order.</p>
	<p>A two-dimensional array is specified using two subscripts where the first subscript denotes the row and the second denotes the column. The C compiler treats a two-dimensional array as an array of one-dimensional arrays. Figure 3.26 shows a two-dimensional array which can be viewed as an array of arrays.</p>
	<p>Let us see how the elements of a 2D array are stored in a row major order. Here, the elements of the first row are stored before the elements of the second and third rows. That is, the elements of the array are stored row by row where n elements of the first row will occupy the first n locations. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.29.</p>
